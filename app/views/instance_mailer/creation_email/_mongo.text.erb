Your MongoDB specific configuration is...

User: <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'username' ] %>

Password: Get it by logging into your GridKick account and viewing your instances.

You can try it out right away by connecting with the `mongo` CLI in your terminal:

$ mongo <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'host' ] %>:<%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'port' ] %>/admin --username <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first['username'] %> -p

...and running the `show dbs` command:

# show dbs

If the above command is successful, you will see an empty list and the disk size of your database.
