Your Postgres database specific configuration is...

User: <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'username' ] %>

Password: Get it by logging into your GridKick account and viewing your instances.

You can try it out right away by connecting with the `psql` CLI in your terminal:

$ psql -h <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'host' ] %> -p <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'port' ] %> -U <%= @instance.foreign_instance_data.first[ 'username' ] %> postgres

If the above command is successful, you will be connected to the remote database terminal after you enter your provided password.
